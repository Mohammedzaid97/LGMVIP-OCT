            <h2>Basic note for a beginner </h2>
            <p>
              “Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.”
                     —Bill Gates

            Important steps for a beginner to know befor starting coding
            <h3>#1 Set Up Goals  </h3>
                    Goal setting can…

                      Boost motivation
                      Instill a sense of power over your learning
                      Focus your efforts and energies

            <h3>#2 Practice Patience</h3>
                    Be a human, not a computer – Some beginning coders might think the best programming approach is to think like a computer. But instead, your job is to teach computers to be more human. 
            
 
          <h3>#3 Practice Coding By Hand</h3>
              This is recommended by almost every experienced coder out there. Learning to write code by hand will make you a better coder. Studies show that your brain has an easier time retaining information when it's written out.  
       <h3> #4 Learn By Doing, Not Memorizing</h3>
        Learning to code is a lot like riding a bike. It’s something you learn by doing. Although it may be intimidating at first, try to jump into as many projects and hands-on learning experiences as you can.

              <h3>Basic note for a Intermidiate learner </h3>
            <p>"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."" 
                 – Mahatma Gandhi


           <h3> #1. Code and more Code</h3>
          Practicing coding daily will significantly improve your coding skill for sure. There is a say
    "Ten thousands lines of code makes you a good programmer or ten thousand hours of coding.""
          Try to solve as many problems as you can. Participate in coding challenges. There are lots of competition happening each year. Competitive programming is also a good way to test your ability.
      

          <h3>#2. Find a good Mentor</h3>

            There is always someone better than you. Reach those people. Even if you are in the workplace, ask your seniors for mentorship. Join local coding Bootcamp happening in your area. Meet like-minded people and talk with them.
    If you are in college, there must be someone who can mentor you. A good mentorship definitely helps you improve for sure.

        <h3>#3. Do Side projects</h3>
            Having a side project as a side hustle is always a good idea for developers. You can learn a lot of things that you are not able to learn from your day job. For me, it is a crucial thing.

        <h3>#4. Don’t stick with one Language</h3>
          In an interview, Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, said that nobody should be called a professional if they know only one language. He recommends learning between 3 to 7 languages. His recommended languages are C++, Java, Python, C, C#. He mentioned that those languages will give you a good grasp of programming.

            <h2>Tips  for a PRO-CODERS</h2>

            "Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
                   – Lao Tzu



          <h3>#1. Think different</h3>
The ability to envision and think about objects and concepts that are original in nature yet unexplored is known as abstract thinking or thinking differently. It is a quality of those who are creative and ingenious. Scholars suggest that abstract thinking is inculcated through culture, instruction, and experience rather than being a natural aspect of cognitive development. 

<h3>#2. The devil is in the detail</h3>
Even writing the most simple programme necessitates and encourages increased attention span and precision.
<h3>#3. Socialise</h3>
People assume programming is an individual activity in which communication is not at all involved, which is part of the socially awkward perception about coders.

<h3>#4. Be insanely creative</h3>
Coding is the process of making something new, such as assembling genetic material to make a genome. When you learn a new language, even if it's a computer language, you broaden your medium of expression.
As coders bring the outcome of their abstract thought to life, creativity is greatly enhanced.

              E-learning has proved to be the best means in the corporate sector, especially when training programs are conducted by MNCs for professionals across the globe and employees are able to acquire important skills while sitting in a board room, or by having seminars, which are conducted for employees of the same or the different organizations under one roof. The schools which use E-learning technologies are a step ahead of those which still have the traditional approach towards learning.
